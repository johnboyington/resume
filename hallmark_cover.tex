\begin{resume}
 

To whom it may concern,

%%% intro paragraph (summarize what is the job, why i am interested, and what makes me a good fit)

% who am i, because that fits
As a generalist constantly seeking new disciplines to study and ways to challenge myself, I would like to express my serious interest in your Data Analyst position.
I am currently finishing my masters in Nuclear Engineering from Kansas State University and while there, I've spent the last two and a half years innovating in the nuclear realm, applying artificial intelligence to solve complex optimization problems, collecting and visualizing modestly-sized datasets and developing novel software approaches to speed up workflows, and now I would like to turn my attention to the corporate sector.
I believe that as an analyst, I could continue to grow my repertoire of professional skills, while simultaneously proving to Hallmark to be an indispensible asset through my wide set of mathematic and computational skills, unique perspectives, and ability to communicate.


%%% body paragraphs (list the responsibility, project i participated in, skills i acquired, and impact i had)
Huge datasets are like new continents to be explored, and I'm excited at the idea of diving in in search of hidden insights and surprising trends.
Through the power of data manipulation and visualization I've achieve some notable accomplishments.
These include, 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Demonstrate what materials and geometries produce the most optimal neutron filter.
\item Inform an experimental team about the various radiological hazards during a fuel element analysis.
\end{enumerate}


One of my important tennents as a researcher has been a focus on organization.
I believe that my concision as a technical communicator begins with my ability to code cleanly and beautifully.
Any complex idea can be broken down into a set of simple ideas, so I make sure to take the time to offer care and attention to the smallest details when building any software, so that way things can easily be scaled and my ultimate presentation of any idea is one that is easy to understand and convey.

%%% closing paragraph (re-emphasize interest in position, why i'm passionate about company, why i'd make a good fit)


%%% call to action

Sincerely,
John Boyington
